    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an AI-powered SQL agent that analyses UK insolvency data (2000-2025) to identify macro-economic risk trends. The agent uses natural language queries to automatically generate and execute SQL commands, providing insights into corporate and individual financial distress patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Natural Language SQL Generation**: Ask questions in plain English, get SQL-based answers\n",
    "- **Multi-Table Analysis**: Joins corporate and individual insolvency data\n",
    "- **Temporal Aggregation**: Automatically converts monthly data to yearly trends\n",
    "- **Comparative Analytics**: Identifies trend reversals and ratio calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "- **Company Insolvencies**: [UK Insolvency Service - Company Insolvencies (November 2025)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/company-insolvencies-november-2025)\n",

    "{custom_table_info}\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL RULES:\n",
    "1. AGGREGATION & SYNTAX:\n",
    "   - ALWAYS use `SUM(column)` to aggregate monthly data into yearly totals.\n",
    "   - CORRECT SQL ORDER: `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ...`\n",
    "   - NEVER place `WHERE` after `GROUP BY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. JOIN LOGIC (CRITICAL):\n",
    "   - When querying both tables, you MUST join on BOTH 'year' AND 'month'.\n",
    "   - Correct: `ON t1.year = t2.year AND t1.month = t2.month`\n",
    "   - Wrong: `ON t1.year = t2.year` (This multiplies results by 12!)\n",
    "   - If you see \"ambiguous column name\", use `table.column` (e.g., `retail_risk.year`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. QUESTION LOGIC:\n",
    "   - \"Calculate\" / \"Trend\" (Single Table):\n",
    "      - Query: `SELECT year, SUM(column) FROM table WHERE year IN (...) GROUP BY year`\n",
    "   - \"Ratio\": \n",
    "      - Query: `SELECT SUM(t1.total_ind_insolvencies), SUM(t2.total_co_insolvencies) FROM retail_risk t1 JOIN corporate_risk t2 ON t1.year = t2.year AND t1.month = t2.month WHERE t1.year = 2023`\n",
    "      - Do NOT group by month. Get the single yearly totals directly.\n",
    "      - Calculate ratio in Final Answer.\n",
    "   - \"Compare\" (YEAR-BY-YEAR):\n",
    "      - Query MUST include: `SELECT t1.year, SUM(...), SUM(...) ... GROUP BY t1.year`\n",
    "      - Example: `SELECT t1.year, SUM(t1.compulsory_liquidations), SUM(t2.forced_bankruptcies) FROM corporate_risk t1 JOIN retail_risk t2 ON t1.year = t2.year AND t1.month = t2.month WHERE t1.year BETWEEN 2015 AND 2023 GROUP BY t1.year`\n",
    "      - CRITICAL: Do NOT omit `GROUP BY t1.year`. You need separate rows for each year.\n",
    "      - After execution, compare each row individually.\n",
    "      - For each tuple (year, corp_val, ind_val):\n",
    "         - If corp_val > ind_val, say \"Corp is higher\"\n",
    "         - If ind_val > corp_val, say \"Ind is higher\"\n",
    "      - Format: \"Year: Corp [Value] vs Ind [Value] -> [Winner] is higher\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. EXECUTION:\n",
    "   - You MUST execute the query and use the REAL numbers.\n",
    "   - NEVER make up numbers or use placeholders like 12345.\n",
    "   - If the query fails, fix it and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. TERMINATION:\n",
    "   - Once you have the SQL observation, your ONLY valid next step is \"Final Answer:\".\n",
    "   - Do NOT output \"Action: Thought\", \"Action: None\", or any other action.\n",
    "   - Do NOT try to use python or any other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. FORMAT:\n",
    "   - Final Answer must be based on the SQL result.\n",
    "   - Do not output \"Action:\" after \"Final Answer:\".\n",

    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis above, we can observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trader Bankruptcies (SME Metric)**: The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) showed a significant drop in trader bankruptcies due to government support schemes, followed by a sharp recovery in 2022-2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compulsory Liquidations vs. Forced Bankruptcies**: \n",
    "   - **2015-2019**: Individual forced bankruptcies were consistently higher, reflecting consumer-driven distress.\n",
    "   - **2020**: A trend reversal began (Corp: 1,354 vs Ind: 1,347).\n",
    "   - **2022-2023**: Corporate compulsory liquidations surged, indicating increased business distress post-pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **2023 Insolvency Ratio**: The Individual-to-Corporate insolvency ratio provides a macro-economic health indicator. A higher ratio suggests consumer stress; a lower ratio indicates business sector challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Challenges Solved\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Multiplication Bug**: Initially, queries joined on `year` only, causing 12x inflation (one row per month). Fixed by joining on both `year` AND `month`.\n",
    "2. **Agent Hallucination**: The LLM attempted to calculate comparisons without executing queries. Resolved by enforcing strict prompt rules: \"Execute SQL first, then output Final Answer.\"\n",
    "3. **SQL Syntax Errors**: The agent placed `WHERE` after `GROUP BY`. Fixed by explicitly stating: \"Correct SQL order: SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY\".\n",
    "4. **Infinite Loops**: The agent tried to use `Action: None` or `Action: Thought`, causing parsing errors. Prevented by adding termination rules to the system prompt.\n",
