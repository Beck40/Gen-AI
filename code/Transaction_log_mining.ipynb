    "### Approach\n",
    "1. Vectorise the extracted `root_cause` field using:\n",
    "   - Primary: Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for semantic embeddings\n",
    "   - Fallback: TF-IDF for lightweight text representation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clustering: First try K-Means with optimal cluster count determined by silhouette score, then test with HDBSCAN for model comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Auto-labelling: Use TF-IDF to extract the top 3 keywords representing each cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Identify recurring exception patterns that represent systemic operational issues, rather than isolated incidents."

    "Filtered then sampled 500 high-signal complaint narratives  \n",
    "Extracted structured exception data using LLM (failure types, ISO codes, severity)  \n",
    "Identified recurring error patterns through semantic clustering  \n",
    "Generated actionable insights for operational improvements  \n",

    "### Recommendations\n",
    "Use the prioritised fix list above to focus on the highest-impact clusters, balancing severity with volume. Start with clusters showing high severity and high volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Value\n",
    "This Semantic Intelligence approach enables:\n",
    "- Proactive issue detection: Identify systemic problems before they escalate\n",
    "- Resource optimisation: Focus engineering efforts on the most impactful issues  \n",
    "- Operational resilience: Reduce customer friction through data-driven root-cause analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling Considerations\n",
    "To expand this prototype:\n",
    "1. Increase sample size to 2,000-5,000 records (requires paid LLM tier)\n",
    "2. Integrate real-time log streaming for continuous monitoring\n",
    "3. Deploy predictive models to forecast exception trends\n",
    "4. Build automated alerting for emerging cluster anomalies"
